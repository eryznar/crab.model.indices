# Introduction {-}

The goal of this investigation was to develop spatiotemporal model-based indices of abundance for two Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands (BSAI) crab stocks: Tanner crab (*Chionoecetes bairdi*) and snow crab (*Chionoecetes opilio*). St. Matthew Island blue king crab (*Paralithodes platypus*) and Norton Sound red king crab (*Paralithodes camtschaticus*) model indices are presented in separate documents (Stern et al. 2025a; Stern et al. 2025b). Research suggests that spatiotemporal model-based indices can be more robust to survey changes than design-based indices, though the models must be well-specified (Yalcin et al. 2023). Spatiotemporal model-based indices are used in North Pacific Fishery Management Council (NPFMC) groundfish stock assessments for species including Eastern Bering Sea (EBS) walleye pollock (*Gadus chalcogrammus*) and EBS Pacific cod (*Gadus macrocephalus*), both of which use the vector-autoregressive spatial temporal (VAST) approach (Thorson 2019) to produce indices used in the assessments (Ianelli et al. 2024; Barbeaux et al. 2024). Previous BSAI crab stock assessments have presented models using spatiotemporal model-based indices (e.g., Ianelli et al. 2017), although these models were not accepted for harvest specifications (SSC 2017). 

Biomass and abundance estimates were generated using the R package *sdmTMB* (Anderson et al. 2022), which uses geostatistical time series data to estimate spatial and spatiotemporal generalized linear mixed effects models. This approach allows for index standardization when the set of stations surveyed is not consistent across years: one can generate a spatial grid that covers the area of interest, predict from the model onto that grid, and sum the predicted abundance/biomass to obtain an area-weighted index that is independent of sampling locations (Anderson et al. 2022).

The two stock assessments for the crab stocks presented here use data from the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) Eastern Bering Sea (EBS) bottom trawl survey (Stockhausen 2024; Szuwalski 2024). Due to this, spatiotemporal model-based index development is expected to confer advantages for each stock. Standardizing the survey indices could allow the assessment to use the existing survey data more rigorously. Throughout its history, the NMFS EBS trawl survey has undergone changes in its spatial footprint, including recently dropping the high sampling density "corner stations" near St. Matthew Island from 2024 onward (DeFilippo et al. 2023); index standardization would allow assessments to continue using the full time series of data despite these changes. 

Spatiotemporal index standardization can also be accomplished using VAST. However, compared to *sdmTMB*, VAST is often criticized for having a difficult user interface, slower estimation times, and less-flexible model specification. Therefore, *sdmTMB* is primarily used the following index standardization. 

# Methods {-}

Models were fit using the R package *sdmTMB*. A number of decision points arise in *sdmTMB*, including:

- The resolution of the spatial mesh used in fitting the model. A higher number of knots, specified when creating the spatial mesh using the make_mesh() function, indicates a higher resolution mesh. 

- The spatiotemporal random fields estimation method. The spatiotemporal random fields can be estimated as independent and identically distributed (IID), first-order autoregressive (AR1), a random walk, or fixed at zero. The spatial random fields are estimated for each time slice, the period of which is specified in the model (e.g., time = year). 

- The model family. Many options exist, including tweedie(), delta_gamma(), and delta_lognormal(). 

For each stock, a range of models were ran to examine the effects of choices at each of these decision points on model predictions. After fitting models, the following steps for model evaluation were used:

- First, model convergence was evaluated using the sdmTMB::sanity() function. Output of this function for a model that passes all sanity checks is displayed as follows:

$\checkmark$ Non-linear minimizer suggests successful convergence  

$\checkmark$ Hessian matrix is positive definite  

$\checkmark$ No extreme or very small eigenvalues detected  

$\checkmark$ No gradients with respect to fixed effects are >= 0.001  

$\checkmark$ No fixed-effect standard errors are NA  

$\checkmark$ No standard errors look unreasonably large  

$\checkmark$ No sigma parameters are < 0.01  

$\checkmark$ No sigma parameters are > 100  

$\checkmark$ Range parameter doesn't look unreasonably large

- If a model passed all the sanity checks, the R package *DHARMa* (Hartig 2022) was used to calculate the DHARMa residuals using the function DHARMa::dharma_residuals(). Models that did not pass the sanity checks were excluded from further consideration.

- DHARMa residual Q-Q plots and evidence of quantile deviations, under- or overdispersion, outliers, and zero- inflation were examined using the functions DHARMa::testQuantiles(), DHARMa::testDispersion(), DHARMa::testOutliers(), and DHARMa::testZeroInflation(), respectively. Plots of DHARMa residuals were examined over space and time for potential patterns of autocorrelation. 

- Model predictive skill was evaluated (the predictive ability of the model for new observations; Anderson *et al.* 2024) using the cross validation function sdmTMB_cv(). This function measures model predictive skill by holding out subsets of the data in turn and using each as a test set. These subsets of data are termed "folds". To compare models, cross validation was conducted with three folds for each model then the model's summed log-likelihood value was extracted, which represents the model's predictive density. Predictive density values closer to zero indicate better out-of-sample predictive skill. Model-predicted indices were also plotted against observed values and examined for goodness-of-fit. 

- Finally, model-predicted indices were compared using the best model framework for each stock with indices generated in VAST (when available) using a comparable framework to evaluate potential differences in index generation between model algorithms. 

## Tanner crab {-}

Abundance and biomass data collected from the NMFS EBS bottom trawl survey (1975-2024) were utilized to fit Tanner crab models in *sdmTMB*. Sex-maturity categories included all males combined, immature females, and mature females to align with the stock assessment model, and data were filtered to only include crab with a carapace width greater than or equal to 25mm. As the survey gear and methods were standardized in 1982 (Stauffer 2004), separate models were fit to data before 1982 and data in and after 1982 for each sex-size/maturity category. To evaluate decision points for model formulations, models were fit using a 50-knot, 90-knot, and 120-knot mesh (Figures \@ref(fig:bairdi-50-mesh) - \@ref(fig:bairdi-120-mesh)), a Tweedie or delta-gamma model family, and a IID spatiotemporal random field. Models fit using the delta-lognormal family did not pass initial model sanity checks and models using an AR1 or random walk spatiotemporal random field did not converge. Therefore, these frameworks are not discussed further. The best model framework was used to predict Tanner crab abundance and biomass on an EBS-wide survey grid (Figure \@ref(fig:bairdi-EBS-grid)), a grid encompassing the EBS area west of 166° (for the Tanner West stock; Figure \@ref(fig:bairdi-west-grid), Appendix), and a grid encompassing the EBS area east of 166° (for the Tanner East stock; Figure \@ref(fig:bairdi-east-grid), Appendix). Each prediction grid was a resolution of 5 km$^2$.

## Snow crab {-}

Biomass data collected from the NMFS EBS (1980-2024) and Northern Bering Sea (NBS; 2010, 2017-2019, 2021-2023) bottom trawl survey was used to fit snow crab models in *sdmTMB*. Sex-size/maturity categories included males greater than 95mm and mature females to align with the stock assessment model. To evaluate decision points for model formulations, models were fit using a 50-knot, 90-knot, and 120-knot mesh for EBS data only (Figure \@ref(fig:snow-EBS-mesh)) and EBS-NBS data combined (Figure \@ref(fig:snow-NBS-mesh)), a Tweedie or delta-gamma model family, and a IID spatiotemporal random field for EBS-only models. An AR1 random field was used for models fit using EBS and NBS data, as this method is suitable for data where years are not continuous, as is the case for NBS survey data. The best model framework was then used to predict snow crab biomass on an EBS-wide survey grid (Figure \@ref(fig:snow-EBS-grid)). The prediction grid was a resolution of 5 km$^2$. Models initially were fit using EBS data only then compared to models fit with both EBS and NBS data to evaluate if including NBS data enhanced model performance.

### Model diagnostics {-}

All models passed sanity checks. Model diagnostics using DHARMa residuals varied among the number of knots specified in the mesh (50, 90, 120), model family (Tweedie, delta-gamma), and data period (pre-1982, 1982 onward) for both abundance (Table \@ref(tab:bairdi-abund-modeleval)) and biomass (Table \@ref(tab:bairdi-bio-modeleval)) models. For male abundance, a model using a delta-gamma distribution and 50 knots performed the best for both periods in terms of the greatest log-likelihood, with only the post-1982 model showing evidence of outliers, zero-inflation, and quantile deviations. However, this was true regardless of the model family or number of knots used, and this pattern was consistent across other sex-maturity categories. For immature female abundance, a delta-gamma model had the largest log-likelihood across periods, with models using 90 and 50 knots performing best pre-1982 and post-1982, respectively. The best model pre-1982 showed evidence of quantile deviation and dispersion, whereas the best model post-1982 showed evidence of outliers, zero-inflation, and quantile deviation. Contrasting the other two sex-maturity categories, the Tweedie family had the largest log-likelihood for mature female abundance, with 90 and 50 knots performing best pre-1982 and post-1982, respectively. The pre-1982 Tweedie model only showed evidence of zero-inflation, whereas the post-1982 Tweedie model showed evidence of outliers, dispersion, zero-inflation, and quantile deviation. 

As with male abundance, a delta-gamma model using 50 knots had the largest log-likelihood for male biomass pre- and post-1982. Models for both periods showed evidence of quantile deviation, dispersion, and outliers, where just the post-1982 model also showed evidence of zero-inflation as was true for other models in this period. For immature female biomass, a Tweedie model using 90 and 50 knots for pre- and post-1982 had the greatest log-likelihood. While the pre-1982 Tweedie model had the largest log-likelihood, it showed evidence of dispersion and zero-inflation whereas the next-best model, a delta-gamma using 90 knots, did not. For immature female biomass post-1982, Tweedie and delta-gamma models using 50 knots had the largest and very similar log-likelihoods, with the Tweedie model showing evidence of quantile deviation, dispersion, outliers, and zero-inflation where the delta-gamma model did not show evidence of dispersion. A similar pattern was seen in diagnostics for mature female biomass models, where Tweedie models using 50 knots had the largest but very similar log-likelihood values to delta-gamma models using 50 knots across both periods. The pre-1982 50-knot Tweedie model showed evidence of dispersion, outliers, and zero-inflation, whereas the 50-knot delta-gamma model did not. The post-1982 50-knot Tweedie model exhibited evidence of all diagnostics, whereas the 50-knot delta-gamma model did not show evidence of dispersion.

Accounting for strong model performance across sex-maturity categories, periods, and response (abundance/biomass), a delta-gamma model family and a 50-knot mesh was selected as a parsimonious model framework for prediction. DHARMa residuals for these models across sex-maturity categories and periods did not strongly diverge from the 1-1 line (Figures \@ref(fig:DHARMa-abund-QQ-50) - \@ref(fig:DHARMa-bio-QQ-50)) despite some evidence of quantile dispersion. In addition, DHARMa residuals for these models did not show evidence of spatiotemporal autocorrelation (Figures \@ref(fig:DHARMa-abund-spat-50-male) - \@ref(fig:DHARMa-bio-spat-50-matfem)).

### Predicted abundance and biomass {-}

Heat maps of EBS-wide predicted abundance for Tanner crab males, immature females, and mature females are shown in figures \@ref(fig:spatpred-abund-50-male) - \@ref(fig:spatpred-abund-50-matfem), respectively, using our chosen model framework (delta-gamma, 50 knots). Heat maps of EBS-wide predicted biomass for Tanner crab males, immature females, and mature females are shown in figures \@ref(fig:spatpred-bio-50-male) - \@ref(fig:spatpred-bio-50-matfem). Abundance and biomass heat maps for Tanner crab west and east of 166° are shown in Appendix figures \@ref(fig:spatpred-abund-50-maleW) - \@ref(fig:spatpred-bio-50-matfemW) and figures \@ref(fig:spatpred-abund-50-maleE) - \@ref(fig:spatpred-bio-50-matfemE), respectively. 

### Predicted index fits to observations {-}
The EBS-wide model-predicted indices using a delta-gamma family varied in their fits to survey abundance (Figure \@ref(fig:bairdi-abund-index)) and biomass observations (Figure \@ref(fig:bairdi-bio-index)) across sex-maturity categories and between model fitting periods. Across sex-maturity categories, model fits with different knots were most variable before 1982, which could be due to high variability in the spatial footprint of the survey in this period. In this period, uncertainty was generally greater in indices predicted using 50 knots, with the majority of survey observations points and associated uncertainty overlapping with model predicted values and uncertainty. From 1982 onward, indices predicted at different knots are less variable compared with each other, with models using 50 knots generally exhibiting greater uncertainty than 90 and 120 knots. As before, the majority of survey observations points and associated uncertainty overlap with model predicted values and uncertainty across knot specifications. Similar patterns across knots and sex-maturity categories were seen for predicted abundance and biomass indices for Tanners west and east of 166° (Figures \@ref(fig:Westbairdi-abund-index) - \@ref(fig:Eastbairdi-bio-index), Appendix).

### Comparison of *sdmTMB* with VAST {-}
For the EBS, abundance and biomass indices were similar between *sdmTMB* and VAST estimates (Figures \@ref(fig:EBSbairdi-abund-compare) - \@ref(fig:EBSbairdi-bio-compare)). Across sex-maturity categories, the greatest differences in *sdmTMB* and VAST estimates were in the pre-1982 period, with *sdmTMB* estimates generally exhibiting greater uncertainty in this period. Among sex-maturity categories, the greatest difference in estimates were for mature females, where *sdmTMB* estimates were generally slightly higher than VAST but still tracking the observed survey values. Similar patterns were seen in *sdmTMB* and VAST estimates for Tanner crab west of 166° (Figures \@ref(fig:Westbairdi-abund-compare) - \@ref(fig:Westbairdi-bio-compare), Appendix) and east of 166°(Figures \@ref(fig:Eastbairdi-abund-compare) - \@ref(fig:Eastbairdi-bio-compare), Appendix).

### Model diagnostics {-}

All models passed sanity checks. Model diagnostics using DHARMa residuals varied among the number of knots specified in the mesh (50, 90, 120) and model family (Tweedie, delta-gamma) for biomass models (Table \@ref(tab:snow-bio-modeleval)). For male biomass >95mm using EBS data only, a delta-gamma model using 90 knots had the largest log-likelihood. This model showed evidence of quantile deviation, outliers, and zero-inflation which was not improved when models were fit using 50 or 120 knots or a Tweedie distribution. For mature female biomass using EBS data only, a delta-gamma model using 50 knots had the greatest log-likelihood. As with males, this model showed evidence of quantile deviation, outliers, and zero-inflation which was not improved using a  different numbers of knots or distribution. For male biomass fit with EBS and NBS data, a delta-gamma model using 90 knots had the largest log-likelihood. However, as with the EBS-only models, this model showed evidence of quantile deviation, outliers, and zero-inflation regardless of the number of knots. For mature female biomass fit with EBS and NBS data, a model fit with 50 knots had the largest log-likelihood but still showed evidence of quantile deviation, outliers, and zero-inflation. 

A delta-gamma model family was selected along with a 90-knot mesh for males >95mm and a 50-knot mesh for mature females as the top-performing model framework for each sex-size/maturity category. DHARMa residuals for these models fit using EBS data only (Figures \@ref(fig:snow-DHARMa-male95-QQ-90-EBS) - \@ref(fig:snow-DHARMa-matfem-QQ-50-EBS)) as well as models using EBS and NBS data (Figures \@ref(fig:snow-DHARMa-male95-QQ-90-EBSNBS) - \@ref(fig:snow-DHARMa-matfem-QQ-50-EBSNBS))  did not strongly diverge from the 1-1 line despite some evidence of quantile dispersion. Spatial DHARMa residuals for these models using EBS-only data did not show evidence of spatiotemporal autocorrelation (Figures \@ref(fig:snow-DHARMa-spat-90-male95-EBS) - \@ref(fig:snow-DHARMa-spat-50-matfem-EBS)). However, models using these knots and both EBS and NBS data displayed evidence of spatiotemporal autocorrelation, specifically in the NBS portion of the grid for mature female predictions (Figures \@ref(fig:snow-DHARMa-spat-90-male95-EBSNBS) - \@ref(fig:snow-DHARMa-spat-50-matfem-EBSNBS)).

### Predicted abundance and biomass {-}

Heat maps of EBS-wide predicted biomass for snow crab males >95mm and mature females using EBS data only are shown in figures \@ref(fig:snow-spatpred-bio-90-male-EBS) - \@ref(fig:snow-spatpred-bio-50-matfem-EBS), respectively, using our chosen model framework (delta-gamma, 90 knots for males > 95mm, 50 knots for mature females). Heat maps of EBS-wide predicted biomass using EBS and NBS data are shown in figures \@ref(fig:snow-spatpred-bio-90-male-EBSNBS) - \@ref(fig:snow-spatpred-bio-50-matfem-EBSNBS)

### Predicted index fits to observations {-}
The EBS-wide model-predicted indices using a delta-gamma family and EBS-only data varied in their fits to survey biomass observations (Figure \@ref(fig:snow-bio-index-EBS)) between sex-size/maturity categories and the number of knots used in the model mesh. For males > 95mm, there was generally greater uncertainty in model indices before ~2000 regardless of knot specification, which corresponds to survey observations. Indices and associated confidence intervals across all knot specifications overlapped the confidence intervals of the survey observations. Therefore, there were no strong differences in performance among the number of knots for male indices. Indices for mature females displayed greater uncertainty than for males, which also corresponds with greater uncertainty in the survey observations. Mature female estimated biomass using 50 knots was generally slightly lower than biomass using 90 or 120 knots. The 50-knot index tracked survey observations more so than the other knot specifications, overlapping the survey values and associated uncertainty each year. 

Comparing indices generated from the best models for males > 95mm (delta-gamma, 90 knots) and mature females (delta-gamma, 50 knots) built using EBS data only and EBS and NBS data combined illustrated different alignment with the survey data between sex-size/maturity categories (Figure \@ref(fig:snow-bio-index-EBSNBS)). For males, biomass indices and associated uncertainty were very similar to each other and survey observations across the time series regardless of what data region was used to fit the models. Biomass indices using EBS data only were slightly higher across years with slightly larger confidence intervals than indices using EBS and NBS data. For mature females, the biomass predicted from the EBS data only model is generally higher across the time series and seems to track the survey data better earlier in the time series, specifically pre-1990. Post 1990, the index from the model that also includes NBS data follows the survey observations more closely and generally with less uncertainty, though the indices and associated confidence intervals overlap the survey observations most years regardless of the data region used to fit the models. 

### Comparison of *sdmTMB* with VAST {-}
Updated VAST indices for snow crab are not available, so we only present sdmTMB indices. 


# Recommended models {-}
For Tanner crab, we recommend a delta-gamma model using a 50-knot mesh as these were consistently top-performing models across sex-maturity categories and periods. However, different best models could be selected by sex-maturity category and fitting period such as delta-gamma models using 90 knots. 

For snow crab, we recommend a delta-gamma model using a 90-knot mesh for males >95mm and a delta-gamma model using a 50-knot mesh for mature females, as these were the top-performing models for each sex-size/maturity category in terms of log-likelihood, other residual diagnostics, and index similarity with survey data.
